We implement dictionaries because is more fast pass a dictionary than calculate in every called at the function min or max.
In the algorithm min_max
When we recalculate the possible results we get in seconds 9.52s, 8.82s, 9.05s, 14.02s and 10.46s
When we save actions in dictionaries the possible results we get in seconds 7.57s, 7.63s, 7.48s, 7.39s and 8.06s
